1. Question 1
Suppose your training examples are sentences (sequences of words). Which of the following refers to the j^{th}j 
th
  word in the i^{th}i 
t
  training example?
x(i)<j>


2. Tx=Ty
​	
3. Question 3
To which of these tasks would you apply a many-to-one RNN architecture? (Check all that apply).

Sentiment classification (input a piece of text and output a 0/1 to denote positive or negative sentiment)
Gender recognition from speech (input an audio clip and output a label indicating the speaker’s gender)

4.You are training this RNN language model.
At the t^{th}t th  time step, what is the RNN doing? Choose the best answer.

Estimating P(y<1>,y<2>,…,y<t−1>)


5. Question 5
You have finished training a language model RNN and are using it to sample random sentences, as follows:
(i) Use the probabilities output by the RNN to randomly sample a chosen word for that time-step as y^<t>. (ii) Then pass this selected word to the next time-step.


6. Question 6
You are training an RNN, and find that your weights and activations are all taking on the value of NaN (“Not a Number”). Which of these is the most likely cause of this problem?

Eploding 

7. Question 7
Suppose you are training a LSTM. You have a 10000 word vocabulary, and are using an LSTM with 100-dimensional activations a^{<t>}a <t>. What is the dimension of Γu at each time step?

10000

8. Here’re the update equations for the GRU.

Betty’s model (removing Γr), because if Γu≈0 for a timestep, the gradient can propagate back through that timestep without much decay.

9. Question 9
Here are the equations for the GRU and the LSTM:

From these, we can see that the Update Gate and Forget Gate in the LSTM play a role similar to _______ and ______ in the GRU. What should go in the the blanks?


Γu and 1−Γu


Question 10
You have a pet dog whose mood is heavily dependent on the current and past few days’ weather. You’ve collected data for the past 365 days on the weather, which you represent as a sequence as x<1>,…,x<365>. You’ve also collected data on your dog’s mood, which you represent as y<1>,…,y<365>. You’d like to build a model to map from x \rightarrow yx→y. Should you use a Unidirectional RNN or Bidirectional RNN for this problem?


answer3___   Unidirectional RNN, because the value of y^{<t>}y 
<t>
  depends only on x<1>,…,x<t>, but not on x<t+1>,…,x<365>



XXXUnidirectional RNN, because the value of y^{<t>}y 
<t>
  depends only on x^{<t>}x 
<t>
 , and not other days’ weather.
