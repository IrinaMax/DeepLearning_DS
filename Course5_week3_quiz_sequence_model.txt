Question 1
Correct
1 / 1
point
1. Question 1
Consider using this encoder-decoder model for machine translation.

This model is a “conditional language model” in the sense that the encoder portion (shown in green) is modeling the probability of the input sentence xx.


True

False
Correct 

Question 2

2. Question 2
In beam search, if you increase the beam width BB, which of the following would you expect to be true? Check all that apply.


Beam search will run more slowly.

Correct 

Beam search will use up more memory.

Correct 

Beam search will generally find better solutions (i.e. do a better job maximizing P(y∣x))

Correct 

Beam search will converge after fewer steps.

Un-selected is correct 

Question 3
Correct
1 / 1
point
3. Question 3
In machine translation, if we carry out beam search without using sentence normalization, the algorithm will tend to output overly short translations.


True

Correct 

False

Question 4
Correct
1 / 1
point
4. Question 4
Suppose you are building a speech recognition system, which uses an RNN model to map from audio clip xx to a text transcript yy. Your algorithm uses beam search to try to find the value of yy that maximizes P(y∣x).

On a dev set example, given an input audio clip, your algorithm outputs the transcript y^= “I’m building an A Eye system in Silly con Valley.”, whereas a human gives a much superior transcript y^* =y 
∗
 = “I’m building an AI system in Silicon Valley.”

According to your model,

P(y^∣x)=1.09∗10−7
P(y∗∣x)=7.21∗10−8
Would you expect increasing the beam width B to help correct this example?


No, because P(y∗∣x)≤P(y^∣x) indicates the error should be attributed to the RNN rather than to the search algorithm.

Correct 

No, because P(y∗∣x)≤P(y^∣x) indicates the error should be attributed to the search algorithm rather than to the RNN.


Yes, because P(y∗∣x)≤P(y^∣x) indicates the error should be attributed to the RNN rather than to the search algorithm.


Yes, because P(y∗∣x)≤P(y^∣x) indicates the error should be attributed to the search algorithm rather than to the RNN.

Question 5
Correct
1 / 1
point
5. Question 5
Continuing the example from Q4, suppose you work on your algorithm for a few more weeks, and now find that for the vast majority of examples on which your algorithm makes a mistake, P(y∗∣x)>P(y^∣x). This suggest you should focus your attention on improving the search algorithm.


True.

Correct 

False.

Question 6
Correct
1 / 1
point
6. Question 6
Consider the attention model for machine translation.


Further, here is the formula for α<t,t′>.


Which of the following statements about α<t,t′> are true? Check all that apply.


We expect α<t,t′> to be generally larger for values of a<t′> that are highly relevant to the value the network should output for y^{<t>}y 
<t>
 . (Note the indices in the superscripts.)

Correct 

We expect α<t,t′> to be generally larger for values of a^{<t>}a 
<t>
  that are highly relevant to the value the network should output for y<t′>. (Note the indices in the superscripts.)

Un-selected is correct 

∑tα<t,t′>=1 (Note the summation is over tt.)

Un-selected is correct 

∑t′α<t,t′>=1 (Note the summation is over t′.)

Correct 
Question 7
Correct
1 / 1
point
7. Question 7
The network learns where to “pay attention” by learning the values e<t,t′>, which are computed using a small neural network:

We can't replace s^{<t-1>}s 
<t−1>
  with s^{<t>}s 
<t>
  as an input to this neural network. This is because s^{<t>}s 
<t>
  depends on α<t,t′> which in turn depends on e<t,t′>; so at the time we need to evalute this network, we haven’t computed s^{<t>}s 
<t>
  yet.


True

Correct 

False

Question 8
Correct
1 / 1
point
8. Question 8
Compared to the encoder-decoder model shown in Question 1 of this quiz (which does not use an attention mechanism), we expect the attention model to have the greatest advantage when:


The input sequence length T_xT 
x
​	  is large.

Correct 

The input sequence length T_xT 
x
​	  is small.

Question 9
Correct
1 / 1
point
9. Question 9
Under the CTC model, identical repeated characters not separated by the “blank” character (_) are collapsed. Under the CTC model, what does the following string collapse to?

__c_oo_o_kk___b_ooooo__oo__kkk


cokbok


cookbook

Correct 

cook book


coookkboooooookkk

Question 10
Correct
1 / 1
point
10. Question 10
In trigger word detection, x^{<t>}x 
<t>
  is:


Features of the audio (such as spectrogram features) at time tt.

Correct 

The tt-th input word, represented as either a one-hot vector or a word embedding.


Whether the trigger word is being said at time tt.


Whether someone has just finished saying the trigger word at time tt.
